This dataset is about **Medical Insurance Price Prediction**, where you’ll build a model to estimate insurance costs based on different factors like age, BMI, smoking habits, and more.

### 📌 **Understanding the Dataset**

Each row in the dataset represents an individual, and each column contains information about them:

| Column Name  | Description                                                                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **age**      | Age of the person                                                                      |
| **sex**      | Gender (`male` or `female`)                                                            |
| **bmi**      | Body Mass Index (a measure of body fat)                                                |
| **children** | Number of children the person has                                                      |
| **smoker**   | Whether the person is a smoker (`yes` or `no`)                                         |
| **region**   | The region where the person lives (`southwest`, `southeast`, `northwest`, `northeast`) |
| **charges**  | The **insurance cost** (this is the **target variable** to predict)                    |

### 🔍 **What You Need to Do in the Project**

You'll be developing a **regression model** to predict **insurance charges** based on the input features.

### 🛠 **Steps to Follow**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

    - Check for missing values
    - Analyze distributions using histograms, boxplots
    - Identify correlations (heatmaps, scatter plots)

2. **Data Preprocessing**

    - Convert categorical variables (`sex`, `smoker`, `region`) into numerical values using **one-hot encoding**
    - Normalize numerical features (`age`, `bmi`, `children`) if needed

3. **Train Different Regression Models**

    - **Simple Linear Regression (SLR)** → Try predicting `charges` using **one** feature like `age`
    - **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** → Use multiple features (`age`, `bmi`, `smoker`, etc.)
    - **Polynomial Regression** → Check if adding polynomial terms improves accuracy
    - **Ridge Regression** → To prevent overfitting

4. **Model Evaluation**

    - Use **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **R-squared (R²)**, and **cross-validation** to check performance
    - **GridSearchCV** to optimize hyperparameters (e.g., alpha in Ridge Regression)

5. **Make Predictions & Interpret Results**
    - Predict insurance costs for new individuals
    - Explain which features affect insurance charges the most (e.g., **smokers pay more!** 🚬🔥)

### 📊 **Key Insights You Can Extract**

-   **Does BMI affect insurance cost significantly?**
-   **How much more do smokers pay compared to non-smokers?**
-   **Does region play a role in insurance pricing?**
-   **Does age have a linear relationship with insurance charges?**

This project will test your regression modeling skills, feature engineering, and model evaluation. 🚀
